# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Rule 5
The winner of a dance is the couple who is placed first by an absolute majority of Adjudicators, second place is awarded to the couple placed second or higher by an absolute majority, and the remaining places are progressively allocated in a similar way.

## Rule 6
If two or more couples have a majority for the same position, the couple with the largest majority shall be allocated the position under review, and the couple holding the next largest majority is allocated the following position.

## Rule 7
If two or more couples have an equal Majority for the same position…
### Rule 7A
If such majorities are equal, then we add together the marks given by those Adjudicators who form the majority and the Couple with the lowest total (or aggregate) is allocated the position under review. The next position is awarded to the Couple with the next lowest aggregate.
### Rule 7B
If the aggregates of marks are also equal, then the next lower place (or subsequent places if necessary) in respect of the particular Couples concerned, must also be taken into account

## Rule 8
If no couple receives a majority for the position under review then you must proceed by including the next place marks in the calculation. If still no majority is found then we include the next place marks, and if necessary, the next again until a majority vote is found.

## Allocate tied plae markings
When two or more Couples have identical concluding place markings then the Couples have TIED for the positions under review. As all the couples involved are considered equal in placing for the dance, they are allocated the MEAN of the positions under review.
